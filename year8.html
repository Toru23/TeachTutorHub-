                        <p>• The NIC provides a physical connection between the networking cable and the computers.</p>
                        <p>• NICS come in three basic varieties: 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or more.
                            The larger the number of bits that can be transferred to the NIC, the faster the NIC can transfer data to the network cable.</p>
                        <p>• Most NICs are internal with the card fitting into an expansion slot in the computer or built in the motherboard.</p>

                        <p>• On this network, all computers can communicate directly with each other.</p>
                        <p>• All the nodes connected to a hub share the bandwidth among themselves.</p>
                        <p>• Support 8, 12 or 24 ports.</p>
                        <p>• Always used in a star topology.</p>

                        <p>• A switch is a small hardware device that joins multiple computers together within one Local Area Network (LAN).</p>
                        <p>• A switches generally contains more intelligence than a hub.</p>
                        <p>• Unlike hubs, switches are capable of inspecting data packets as they are received, determining the source and destination device of each packet, and forwarding them appropriately.</p>
                        <p>• Allow several users to send information over a network at the same time without slowing each other down.</p>

                        <h4>5. Repeater</h4>
                        <p>• Since a signal loses strength as it passes along cable, it is often necessary to boost the signal with a device called a repeater.</p>
                        <p>• A repeater is an electronic device that receives a signal, cleans it of unnecessary noise, regenerates it, and retransmits it at a higher power level so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation.</p>
                        <p>• A good example of the use of repeaters would be in a local area network using a star topology.</p>
                        <p>• It is wired / wireless.</p>
                        <p>• Regenerates and propagates all electrical transmissions between 2 or more LAN segments.</p>
                        <p>• Allows extension of a network beyond physical length limitations.</p>

                        <p>• A router is an electronic device that interconnects two or more computer networks, and interchanges packets of data between them.</p>
                        <p>• Each data packet contains address information that a router can use to determine if the source and destination are on the same network, or if the data packet must be transferred from one network to another.</p>
                        <p>•  If you have a LAN that you want to connect to the Internet, you will need a router to serve as the translator between information on your LAN and the Internet</p>

                        <p>• A bridge is a device that connects a Local Area Network (LAN) to another Local Area Network that uses the same protocol (for example TCP/IP, Ethernet or token ring).</p>
                        <p>• The function of a bridge is to connect separate networks together that are of the same type of protocol.</p>
                        <p>• A bridge is a device that allows you to segment a large network into two smaller, more efficient networks.</p>
                        <p>• When a packet is received by the bridge, the bridge determines the destination and source segments.</p>

                                <p>► Cloud storage is delivered by a cloud services provider that owns and operates data storage capacity by maintaining large datacenters in multiple locations around the world.</p>
                                <p>► Cloud storage providers manage capacity, security, and durability to make data accessible to youř applications over the internet in a pay-as-you-go model.</p>
                                <p>► Typically, you connect to the storage cloud either through the internet or through a dediçated private connection, using a web portal, website, or a mobile app.</p>
                                <p>► When customers purchase cloud storage from a service provider, they turn over most aspects of the data storage to the vendor, including capacity, security, data availability, storage servers and computing resources, and network data delivery.</p>

                        <p>► These packets are sent out from the computer and they travel around the network seeking out the most efficient route to travel as circuits become available.</p>

                        <p>► Each packet is sent with a 'header address' which tells it where its final destination is, so it knows where to go.</p>
                        <p>► The header address also describes the sequence for reassembly at the destination computer so that the packets are put back into the correct order.</p>
                        <p>► One packet also contains details of how many packets should be arriving so that the recipient computer knows if one packet has failed to turn up.</p>

                        <h3>Circuit Switching</h3>
                        <p>► Circuit switching was designed in 1878 in order to send telephone calls down a dedicated channel.</p>
                        <p>► This channel remains open and in use throughout the whole call and cannot be used by any other data or phone calls.</p>
                        <p>► The telephone message is sent all together; it is not broken up.
                            The message arrives in the same order that it was originally sent.</p>
                        <p>► In modern circuit-switched networks, electronic signals pass through several switches before a connection is established.</p>
                        <p>► During a call no other network traffic can use those switches.</p>
                        <p>► With the expanded use of the Internet for voice and video, analysts predict a gradual shift away from circuit-switched networks.</p>
                        <p>► A circuit-switched network is excellent for data that needs a constant link from end-to-end, for example, real-time video.</p>

                    <h3>Packet Switching vs Circuit Switching</h3> 
                    <div class="col-md-6">
                        <p>► It is easier and less expensive to double the capacity of a packet switched network-a circuit network is heavily dependent on the number of channels available.</p>
                        <p>► Circuit-switched technologies, which take four times long to double their performance/cost, force ISPs to buy that many more boxes to keep up.</p>
                        <p> •This is why everyone is looking for ways to get Internet traffic off the telephone network.</p>
                        <p> •The alternative of building up the telephone network to satisfy the demand growth is economically out of the question.</p>
                        <p>► The battle between circuit and packet technologies has been around a long time, and it is starting to be like the old story of the tortoise and the hare.</p>
                        <p>•In this case, the hare is circuit switching -fast, reliable and smart. The hare starts out fast and keeps a steady pace, while the tortoise starts slow but manages to double his speed every 100 meters.</p>
                        <p>•If the race is longer than 2 km (1.2 miles), the power of compounding favors the tortoise (packet switching).</p>

                        <h3>What is Network Security?</h3>
                        <p>► Network security is a level of quarantee that all the machines in a network are working optimally and the users of these machines only possess the rights that were granted to them</p>
                        <p>► This can include:</p>
                        <p>-preventing unauthorized people from acting on the system maliciously</p>
                        <p>-securing data by anticipating failures</p>
                        <p>-guaranteeing that services are not interrupted</p>

                        <p>► When connecting a matching to a network, we need to make sure no one will easily break in to it.</p>
                        <p>► Even if you don't think anyone will try to break into your machines - chances are that someone might try.</p>
                        <p>► Crackers often run network scan utilities that check a large range of IP addresses, and automatically try to find machines running servers with security holes.</p>
                        <p>► To protect against that, one could simply disable any unnecessary network service they are running.</p>

                        <p>► In the past, hackers were highly skilled programmers who understood the details of computer communications and how to exploit vulnerabilities.</p>
                        <p>► Today almost anyone can become a hacker by downloading tools from the Internet.</p>
                        <p>► These complicated attack tools and generally open networks have generated an increased need for network security and dynarmic security policies.</p>
                        <p>► The easiest way to protect a network from an outside attack is to close it hffnetwork from an outside attack is to close it off completely from the outside world.</p>
                        <p>► A closed network provides connectivity only to trusted known parties and sites; a closed network does not allow a connection to public networks.</p>

                        <h4>Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)</h4>
                        <p>- WPA encrypts information, and checks to make sure that the network security key has not been modified.</p>
                        <p>- WPA also authenticates users to help ensure that only authorized people can access the network.</p>
                        <p>- WPA is designed to work with all wireless network adapters, but it might not work with older routers or access points.</p>

                        <p>- WEP is an older network security method that is still available to support older devices, but it is no longer recommended.</p>
                        <p>- When you enable WEP, you set up a network security key.</p>
                        <p>- This key encrypts the information that one computer sends to another computer across your network. However, WEP security is relatively easy to crack.</p>

                                <h4>What is E-Learning?</h4>
                                <p>E-learning is a learning environment which uses information and communication technologies (ICT's) as a platform for teaching and learning activities. It has been defined as "pedagogy empowered by technology", though 'digital technology' is more accurate. Different studies have found that participants learn five times more material in online learning courses using multimedia content than in traditional face to face courses. Because online courses give students full control over their own learning, students are able to work at their own speed.It is a more relaxed way of learning that is appealing and useful to all age groups. eLearning is popular with those who work full or part-time, as the courses can comfortably be taken at any time and any place rather than having to attend a particular venue at a specified time. </p>

                                <h4>Who use E-learning? </h4>
                                <p>The top industries using eLearning include Healthcare, Technology, Retail and eCommerce, Education, and Construction. Today, eLearning means much more than just delivering 

                                    A survey from 2019 (pre-pandemic conditions) showed that 63% of American high school students use digital learning tools at school every day in comparison to 45% of elementary school students. The usage of digital tools and devices among school students is expected to grow in the coming years. 
                                    E-learning is often used in the workplace for training people. It is used to help people get new skills, for example, IT skills. It is also used when people need to know about new rules or ways of doing things, for example, if a government passes a new law that people in a particular job must know about.
                                    E-learning is never the main type of learning in schools. It may be used by teachers to give you extra help. E-learning can also be used to give you extra challenges. Students can use e-learning at home to do extra study.</p>
